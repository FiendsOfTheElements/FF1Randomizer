<h1>Version 2.0.0</h1>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>I found the SHIP in a treasure chest... but where is it?</b>
<br/>The same place as always: the Dock by Pravoka. Maybe we will change this later.
</li><br/>
</ul>

<h2>Major Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>NPC Shuffle!</h3>
There is a new tab 'Treasures' available with the option to shuffle Treasures and
NPCs. Any NPC that gives an item in the vanilla game can now be shuffled in with the 
treasure shuffle. There are 2 main options, each with additional related options 
the 'Treasures' tab:
<ul>
<li><b>Main NPC Items:</b> This adds Bridge, Lute, Ship, Rod, Canoe, Cube, Bottle
to the pool of items to be shuffled. The NPCs giving those items could have any 
other shuffled treasure instead. (Excluding Caravan which is limited to items that 
show up on the Inventory screen)
</li>
<li><b>Fetch Quest Rewards:</b> This adds Crystal, Herb, Key, Canal, Xcalber, Oxyale, 
and Chime to the pool of items to be shuffled. The NPCs giving those items could have 
any other shuffled treasure instead.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Incentives</h3>
Of the many new incentives options on the 'Treasures' tab, the 3 most important 
ones are related to NPCs and quest items. 
<ul>
<li><b>Incentivized Locations:</b> These options incentivize locations in the game 
or groups of NPCs.
<ul><li><b>Main NPCs:</b> 
This incentivizes King, Princess, Bikke, Sarda, Sage, Robot, and Carvan Item Shop Slot. 
Those NPCs will be treated the same as incentivized teasure chests and will prefer 
to draw an item from the incentivized item pool if possible. Note that the Caravan 
item will still be shuffled by the Shop shuffle too.</li>
<li><b>Fetch Quest NPCs:</b> 
This incentivizes Astos, Matoya, Prince, Nerrick, Smith, Fairy, and Lefein. Those 
NPCs will be treated the same as incentivized teasure chests and will prefer 
to draw an item from the incentivized item pool if possible. If you have both this 
and the 'Other Quest Items' incentivized (see below) it tends to result in a long 
fetch quest kind of like the Crown -> Canal chain in the vanilla early game -- 
except it's random and can be late in the game -- so it's a lot of back and forth 
to get just 1 item in the end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Incentivized Items:</b> In earlier randomizer versions the incentive item 
pool included all required items (Crown, TNT, Slab and sometimes Ruby), Adamant, 
Tail, Masamune, and Ribbon. However, most of the actual required items could not 
be shuffled. With NPC shuffle, any shuffled item that is required will continue to 
be included in the incentive pool by default. This can include Bridge, Lute, Ship, 
Key, Canal, Rod, Canoe, Floater, Cube, Oxyale, Chime but may also include any item 
leading to those items when a partial NPC shuffle is done.
<li><b>Other Quest Items:</b>
This includes any other quest item even if they are not required. These are sometimes
referred to as 'Fetch Quest Items' and would include Crown, Crystal, Herb, TNT, 
Ruby, Bottle, Slab, Adamant when all NPC items are shuffled.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that each incentive option with a group of items or locations 
will only be able to incentivize those items or locations if they are 
<i>shuffled</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Map Edits</h3>
There is a new tab 'Maps' with 2 new options, plus the Ordeals Pillars shuffle 
relocated from the Shuffle tab:
<ul>
<li><b>Keyless ToFR:</b>
Several Mystic KEY locked doors in Temple of Fiends Revisted have been unlocked so
you will not require the KEY to reach Chaos, but some of the treasures remain guarded:
<ul>
<li>The Temple of Fiends treasure rooms right of the entrance remain locked.</li>
<li>All the doors on the Fire Floor are now unlocked except the remote Katana and 26000G rooms.</li>
<li>All the doors on the Water Floor are now unlocked.</li>
<li>The Masmune Chest room on the Air Floor remains unlocked.</li>
</ul>
<br/><img src="~/images/UnlockedToFR.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br/>
</li>
<li><b>Titans Trove:</b>
The Titan moved a few squares to the West and now blocks access to the 
4 treasure chests in this cave even if you come from the backside via the Airship.
This more than triples the chance that RUBY is required (but it's still pretty rare).
<br/><img src="~/images/TitansTrove.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br/>
</li>
<li><b>Open Progression:</b>
This is a collection of small map tweaks that open up the possibilities for item
placement and progression through the game. A total of about 30 map tiles are edited. 
In order:
<ul>
<li>A land path from the starting area to Dwarf Cave. If you get an early CANOE 
you can also walk south across the Canal Bridge to Elfland, Marsh, Cresent Lake, 
and Volcano.
<br/><img src="~/images/WalkToDwarfCave.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br/>
</li>
<li>A small river extension to join the Volcano and Ice Cave river systems near 
the tiny forest in the middle. If you get an early CANOE you can travel from 
Pravoka to Volcano, etc.
<br/><img src="~/images/IceVolcanoRiver.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br/>
</li>
<li>A dock near Onrac and a dock near Mirage Tower. This increases the value of 
the Canal which would otherwise be very unlikely to be required with NPC shuffle. 
With both Main NPC Items and Fetch Quest Rewards shuffle options turned on, this 
means FLOATER is not 100% required to kill Chaos (but you should still always be 
able to find it).
<br/><img src="~/images/OnracDock.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br/>
<br/><img src="~/images/MirageDock.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; max-width:80%;" /><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minor Features &amp; Other Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Free Airship:</b>
The Airship spawns on the starting tile of the game. FLOATER is replaced with a 
cozy CABIN.</li>
<li><b>Free Orbs:</b>
Begin the game with all four orbs lit. That was easy!
</li>
<li><b>Easy Mode:</b>
Chance of random encounters are heavily reduced and all enemys have 10% of their 
HP after the random scaling has been applied. Effectively this turns a 20-500% 
slider into 2-50%, but for HP only.</li>
<li>'Castle Ordeals' has moved to the Maps tab and renamed to Castle Ordeals Pillars</li>
<li>Early Bridge was renamed Free Bridge. The Bridge item is also replaced with a CABIN 
if NPC shuffle is turned on.</li>
<li>Early Rod and Early Canoe have been renamed to Early Sarda Item and Early Sage Item</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>A0 HEALs??:</b>
This can happen with any consumable item but most commonly comes up with HEAL. If 
you have 99 HEALs from shopping and you open a chest with one inside it will 
increment it to 100 but the inventory can't display it so it shows A0, A1, A2, etc.
This generally doesn't hurt anything and the HEAL works as expected. In the original 
game this was also bugged but instead of giving you A0 items it just threw the item 
away.
</li>
<li><b>Astos text is strange:</b>
Overall the NPC item text is less than ideal. It was a quick generic text that 
could be used everywhere and we expect to improve upon it in later versions. Astos
is commonly mentioned as the most strange, and it's worth remembering that in the
vanilla game he also tells you what your reward is for turning in the CROWN before
he attacks you. 
</li>
<li><b>Free Item From the King:</b>
The King is far more trusting of random adventurers in NPC shuffle and he will 
give you the reward item *before* you rescue the Princess. This might be fixed
later on, but usually doesn't make much difference.
</li>
<li><b>Bridge Scene on the Canal:</b>
This is not an error in the randomizer but actually the original game behavior if
you walk over the Canal before walking over the Bridge. That just wasn't possible 
without the map tweaks and you had no reason to try it unless you had the Canoe.
</li>
<li><b>Duplicate Item in Shop:</b>
In some flagsets the Caravan Item Slot isn't incentivized or the randomizer runs 
out of incentive items to put there and it picks a random HEAL or HOUSE instead.
Since the Shop shuffle also mixes things up before the item placement, a duplicate 
item can remain after everything is placed.</li>
<li><b>Flag String is no longer shown on the main menu:</b>
Sadly all the new flags couldn't fit in the default text space on the start screen.
The developers have a fix in progress that should be ready for 2.1 or sooner.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>I think I'm softlocked in the early game. I can't find either the BRIDGE or 
the SHIP, help!</b>
<br/>Try walking from the starting area to the Dwarf Cave. This usually happens 
the first time players try the 'Open Progression' map tweaks with Main NPC Items 
Shuffle on.
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>Why isn't Dr. Unne shuffled?</b>
<br/>In short, it's because he doesn't actually give you an <i>item</i>. He's a 
lot closer to the Elf Doctor that wakes up the Prince. By having an item he sets 
an internal flag for the game to let the other NPC give you something. That being 
said, keep an eye on future versions and maybe Dr. Unne or even the Dragon's Class 
Change events will get shuffled someday too!
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>A second Bridge over the Canal?!?</b>
<br/>If NPC Shuffle options are turned on, a Bridge will be left behind after the
Canal is blown up. This is done to prevent soft locks when you get a very early 
Canoe and could potentially end up stranded on the wrong side of the Canal and unable 
to get back to your Ship. 
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>I've played a few NPC shuffle seeds and it feels like I have to check every 
treasure chest in the game. Is my luck terrible?</b>
<br/>Make sure that you don't have a lot more Items incentivized than there are 
Item Locations to put them. Any incentivized item that doens't make it into an 
incentivized location ends up in a random chest somewhere. If 4 or more required 
items are in random chests you're going to need to check a lot of chests!
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>How many items do I have incentivized?</b>
<br/>It will depend on the flagsets, but in general here are the approximate counts:
<ul>
<li>If you shuffled Treasures only (not shuffle Main NPC Items or Fetch Quest Rewards): 
You have 4 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column.</li>
<li>If you shuffled Treasures and Main NPC Items but not Fetch Quest Rewards: 
You have 10 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column, 
plus 2 additional if you have 'Other Quest Items' checked.</li>
<li>If you shuffled Treasures and Main NPC Items and Fetch Quest Rewards: 
You have 10 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column, 
plus 8 additional if you have 'Other Quest Items' checked.</li>
<li>If you shuffled Treasures and Fetch Quest Rewards but not Main NPC Items: 
You have 4 items in the base pool, plus one for each checkbox in the Items column, 
plus 2 additional if you have 'Other Quest Items' checked.</li>
<li>Other flags may alter this slightly, including the Early Sage convenience flag 
or Open Progression map flag.</li>
</ul>
</li><br/>
<li>
<b>I played the beta version and really liked having *all* of the incentive options. 
Where'd they go?</b>
<br/>Awesome, we love beta testers! A lot of options tested in the beta didn't 
all make the cut for 2.0.0, sorry if your favorite flagset is gone. There's still a 
ton of new options and we can always expand to add those options later on. Stop by 
the discord and let us know what you'd like to see in upcoming versions.
